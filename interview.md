# Interview on Painpoints & Gainpoints regarding Product Quality

## Process
These interview questions will be concluded via google forms, drawing out potential ideas & solutions will be explored via a subset of people as it's time expensive.

## Perspective on Quality, Painpoints and Gainpoints

The following questions aim to explore the pain points and gain points of stakeholders regarding product quality.
Beforehand, we also explore what product quality means

1. How do you personally define "Product Quality" in the context of our digital landscape (e.g., platforms like DiAS)?
   - _Open question_: Describe your understanding of product quality and what it means to you.

2. What are the most important factors for you when evaluating the quality of a digital product?
   - _Scale_: 0 = Not important, 10 = Extremely important.
   - _Factors could include_: stability, user experience, performance, security, maintainability, etc.
   - _Please elaborate_: Why do these factors matter to you?

3. Does the current quality of a product impact your decision-making process when considering future features or requirements?
   - _Scale_: 0 = No impact, 10 = Strong impact.
   - _Optional_: Share any examples where product quality influenced your decisions.

4. How do you measure or assess whether a product is of high quality? What metrics or indicators do you rely on?
   - _Comments_: Share specific metrics, tools, or personal criteria you use to judge product quality.

5. In your opinion, how aligned is the definition of "Product Quality" between different teams (e.g., Business, IT, Developers) within the organization?
   - _Scale_: 0 = Completely misaligned, 10 = Perfectly aligned.
   - _Optional_: Please comment on any areas where you see misalignment or opportunities for improvement.

   - _Scale: 0 = No challenges, 10 = Extremely challenging_
   
2. **How do you currently assess the quality of a product or new feature?**
   - _Scale: 0 = No structured assessment, 10 = Highly structured and well-defined assessment_

## Explorations During Interview

- **If time permits, explore possible visualizations during the interview.**
  - _Stakeholders are asked to sketch potential solutions (Whiteboard or similar tools)._
  - _With whom should we explore visualizations? (Subset)_
    - _Subset of people, based on availability & relevance & scattering._
